## What it is

AI’s common shallow behavior on complex tasks: guessing when information is insufficient, giving a “perfect answer” with no derivation, stacking empty jargon, editing many files without explaining impact, faking completion without verifying. yotta-anti-shallow turns these recurring problems into executable rules, constraining output quality with a forced loop of **analyze first · then execute · self-check after**.

It is not a platform-specific feature; it is an agent-agnostic rule text: drop it into any agent that supports Agent Skills and it takes effect, constraining only output quality — it never takes over execution permissions and needs no resident service.

## Core value

- **Force analyze-before-execute** — for code changes / bug fixes / architecture refactor / doc writing / data analysis / open-ended Q&amp;A, first output the four-element analysis, then act.
- **Graded by complexity to avoid formalistic burden** — L1 simple tasks answer directly; L2 brief analysis then act; L3 full analysis + user confirmation; L4 break into multiple L3s.
- **Transparency assurance** — speculative conclusions must declare confidence (certain / high / medium / low / guess); pseudo-certainty is forbidden.
- **Self-check on completion** — proactively output a self-check report at task end, surfacing doubts and uncovered points.
- **Bottom line cannot be turned off** — when information is insufficient you must say so; never fake completion without verification; if the user interrupts, redo it — these stay in effect even when “rules off” is said.

## Core advantages

| Advantage | Description |
|---|---|
| **Dual-channel activation** | explicit wake-up (“rules on”) + automatic at L3+ tasks; automatic is judged by task nature, not keywords, closing the “didn’t say it, so no scrutiny” loophole |
| **Complexity-graded execution** | L1–L4 grading + length caps (L1 ≤ 200 / L2 analysis ≤ 300 / L3 analysis ≤ 600), neither shallow nor padded |
| **Complete confidence system** | five-tier confidence standard + declaration-strength grading (high confidence one line; medium-and-below full format), transparent without verbosity |
| **Closable but with a floor** | user can temporarily turn off process rules (R001/R003/R004), but the L1 hard floor (F001/F008/R005) can never be turned off |
| **Explicit instruction priority** | if user clearly says “no analysis”, comply and explicitly mark “rules temporarily adjusted”, without arguing |
| **Clear boundary** | pure creative / chat / results-only / pure factual retrieval are not forced to apply, avoiding formalistic burden |
| **Lightweight zero-dependency** | pure rule text, no daemon / no database / no injection; any agent supporting Agent Skills is install-and-use |
| **Ecosystem distribution** | GitHub + npm dual-source synced; four install methods (npx / git clone / Download ZIP / install.sh) covering 17+ agent directories |

## Rules (R001–R008)

| Rule | Effect |
|---|---|
| R001 Analyze before execute | complex tasks first output a four-element analysis; at L3+ execute after confirmation |
| R002 Forbidden behavior | F001–F009: nine forbidden items, e.g. no guessing, no jargon stacking, no faking completion |
| R003 Self-check protocol | proactively self-check after task completion (light / full ≤ 300) |
| R004 Confidence declaration | speculative conclusions labeled with five-tier confidence |
| R005 Interruption handling | user says “stop” → stop immediately, admit gap, re-analyze |
| R006 Complexity grading | L1–L4 graded execution + length caps |
| R007 Closing channel | can temporarily close; the L1 hard floor cannot |
| R008 Explicit instruction priority | user explicit instruction > rule default; conflicts handled per rules |

## Usage

In daily work, this skill activates in two ways: explicitly waking it (“shallow-proof rules on” / “apply the anti-shallow rules”), or automatically when the task reaches L3 (complex) and above. For typical shallow-prone tasks, the flow is:

```text
[REQUEST]  user asks a task
[ANALYZE]   L3+: output four-element analysis (goal / input / uncertainty / plan)
[EXECUTE]   carry out the task (at L3+ wait for user confirmation before acting)
[SELF-CHECK] output a self-check report at the end (confirmed / unconfirmed / risks)
```

The four analysis elements: **goal, input, uncertainty, plan** — state what you want to achieve, what (possibly insufficient) input you have, what is uncertain/unverified, and how you will proceed.

## Trigger

Use it when the user needs deep analysis, end-to-end verification, root-cause tracing, rigorous execution, or careful checking; or when the task is L3 (complex) and above. It is not needed for one-off simple Q&amp;A, pure creative work, or cases where the user only wants a result.

## Installation

Pick any of the four methods below; the order is the recommended priority. Skill files always come from **npm** (GitHub can be slow without a proxy; npm supports mirrors).

### Method 1: npm one-liner (recommended)

```text
# Optional China mirror: npm config set registry https://registry.npmmirror.com
npx -y @yottameta/yotta-anti-shallow --agent <agent-name>      # install to the agent's default user-level skills dir
npx -y @yottameta/yotta-anti-shallow --dir <your-skills-dir>   # point to the skills dir itself (e.g. ~/.codex/skills)
```

- `--agent <name>` installs to that agent's default user-level directory; `--list` shows each agent's default directory.
- `--dir <path>` installs to the given directory; for agents not in the preset list, point `--dir` at their skills directory.
- If the mirror has not synced the new package (404): add `--registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/` (a proxy may be needed in China), or wait for the mirror cache.

### Method 2: git clone (developers / git available)

```text
git clone https://github.com/YottaMeta/yotta-anti-shallow.git <your-skills-dir>/yotta-anti-shallow
```

### Method 3: GitHub Download ZIP (manual / no git)

On the GitHub repository `YottaMeta/yotta-anti-shallow`, click **Code → Download ZIP**, unzip it and put the `yotta-anti-shallow` folder into the agent's skills directory.

### Method 4: install.sh (multi-agent one-liner script)

```text
bash install.sh --agent <name>   # install to the agent's default user-level directory
bash install.sh --dir <path>     # install to the given directory
bash install.sh --list           # list agents -> default directories
```

> Method 1 uses the npm registry (npmmirror / npmjs) and does not depend on GitHub; Methods 2/3 use GitHub and may fail without a proxy in China.
## Upgrade / uninstall

- **Upgrade**: reinstall the latest version to overwrite — rerun the install command you used (e.g. `npx -y @yottameta/yotta-anti-shallow --agent <name>` or `bash install.sh --agent <name>`). Old files in the skill directory are replaced; other project files are untouched.
- **Uninstall**: delete the `yotta-anti-shallow` folder under the target agent’s skills directory (see the table above). After uninstalling, this rules engine no longer takes effect.

## FAQ

- **Will it trigger even for simple tasks?** No. L1 simple tasks (common-sense Q&amp;A, obvious answers) answer directly without forcing the analysis flow.
- **I don’t want to go through the analysis flow every time?** You can say “rules off / skip rules”; R001/R003/R004 close temporarily; the floor rules (F001/F008/R005) still apply.
- **Does it conflict with the host’s built-in Plan / thinking mode?** No. yotta-anti-shallow only constrains output quality; it does not take over execution permissions and is not a substitute for the host’s mode switches.
- **Which tasks suit it?** Tasks that need correctness and rigor: development, troubleshooting, architecture, docs, data analysis, open-ended Q&amp;A. Pure creative / chat / results-only are not forced.
